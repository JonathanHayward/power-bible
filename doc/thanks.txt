I'd like to thank the following people for helping me debug or otherwise
get this program in working order:

    Waidelich Burkhard
    Stuart Cassoff, who furnished the configuration file code
    Bruce Hartweg
    Jeff Hobbs
    Cameron Laird
    Mick O'Donnell
    George Schlitz
    Carl Sukkot, who provided invaluable suggestions

Mike Doyle, for introducing me to Tcl and giving me several good Tcl
books to start hacking with.

and various other people from comp.lang.Tcl whose names I didn't get down.

I'd like to thank the translators of the King James Version, the National
Council of Churches for generously making the Revised Standard Version free for
non-commercial use, and the makers of the Perl, Python, and Tcl tools I've been
priveleged to use.
