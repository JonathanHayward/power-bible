			<h1>The Magic Notebook Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>If you are seeing this message, the Magic Notebook has been set up, but the
privacy policy has not been set up.  Please
<a href="mailto:jonathan.hayward@pobox.com">contact the administrator</a> and request a
privacy policy to be set up.</p>

<p>Entering something into the Magic Notebook is like putting something in
a box, marking it as "private", and putting a lightweight lock onto it.
Honorable people will leave it alone, and casual snoopers won't get in,
but anyone who comes with a crowbar will be able to open it.  The Magic
Notebook is designed to afford basic protection, but not to repel serious
attack; you should therefore <em>not</em> use it to store credit card
information or other sensitive material. Don't put anything in that it
would be bad for other people to be able to break in.</p>

<p>What should you use it for?  Well, here are a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Projects you're working on</li>
<li>Notes on different topics.</li>
<li>Jokes</li>
<li>Quotes</li>
<li>Recipes</li>
<li>Websites to visit</li>
<li>Friends to write/e-mail/call</li>
<li>A to-do list of things you'd like to work on.</li>
<li>Places to visit</li>
<li>Books to read</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
