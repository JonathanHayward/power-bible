<p>"The Holy Bible, Uncensored" is a slightly modified version of the New
Testament and Protestant Old Testament taken from the <a
href="http://ebible.org">World English Bible</a>, together with most of the
Apocrypha taken from the <a
href="http://jonathanhayward.com/powerbible.cgi?BibleVersion=KJV">King James
Version</a>, and III-IV Maccabees and Psalm 151 taken
from <a
href="http://www.ecmarsh.com/lxx/">Sir Lancelot Brenton's translation of the
Septuagint</a>, as modified by various errata. (But the amount that has been
changed isn't really all that much.)</p>

            <li><p>The text of the RSV (that is, the Revised Standard Version)
            is used by gracious permission. The following header is required to
